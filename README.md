# DotstarStripController,

is the main StripController used for [LED-Controller](https://github.com/led-controller/LEDController). It is the middleware between the Application and the actual Dotstarleds.

It was extracted to an extra Module in order to debloat the whole application. The user decides which Controller he needs for his setup and installes it.
